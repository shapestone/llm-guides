## Planning Capabilities

### 0. Preferred Format: Feature Roadmap (Milestones)

**ALWAYS use the milestones.md template for feature roadmaps and multi-milestone planning.**

The milestones template is located at `~/.claude/reference-documentation/projects/milestones.md`

**When to Use the Milestones Template:**
- Planning multi-phase feature releases
- Creating product roadmaps with multiple milestones
- Organizing features by delivery timeframes
- Reporting project progress to stakeholders
- Tracking business value and customer impact across quarters

**Format Features:**
- Visual indicators: üî¥ Priority | ‚≠ê Complexity | üí∞ Business Value | üë§ Customer Impact
- Milestone-based organization with target completion dates
- Feature tables with Priority, Complexity, Business Value, Customer Impact, Effort, Dependencies, Notes
- Timeline overview across all milestones
- Priority Matrix (Must-Have, Should-Have, Nice-to-Have, Future)
- Quarterly resource allocation planning

**Default Output:** Unless the user requests a different format, use the milestones.md template for all feature roadmap planning.

### 1. Backlog Analysis & Cataloging

**When reviewing the backlog, systematically catalog all work items:**

#### Features to Implement
```markdown
- [ ] Feature Name
  - Description: [What it does]
  - Estimated Complexity: Low/Medium/High
  - Dependencies: [List dependencies or "None"]
  - Business Value: High/Medium/Low
  - Stakeholder: [Who requested]
  - Epic/Theme: [Related grouping]
```

#### Technical Debt Items
```markdown
- [ ] Tech Debt Item
  - Impact: [What problems it causes]
  - Effort: [Estimated effort]
  - Risk if not addressed: [Consequences]
```

#### Bug Fixes
```markdown
- [ ] Bug #N
  - Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
  - Affected Users: [Number or %]
  - Workaround: [If available]
```

#### Infrastructure/DevOps Tasks
```markdown
- [ ] Infrastructure Item
  - Purpose: [Why needed]
  - Effort: [Estimated effort]
  - Urgency: [Timeline]
```

### 2. Prioritization Frameworks

Use one or more frameworks to prioritize work:

#### RICE Framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

```
Score = (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort

- Reach: How many users affected? (1-10 scale)
- Impact: How much impact per user? (3=Massive, 2=High, 1=Medium, 0.5=Low, 0.25=Minimal)
- Confidence: How confident in estimates? (100%=High, 80%=Medium, 50%=Low)
- Effort: Person-months of work (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8...)

Example:
Feature A: (5000 users √ó 2 High Impact √ó 80% Confidence) / 2 months = 4000
Feature B: (1000 users √ó 3 Massive Impact √ó 100% Confidence) / 1 month = 3000
‚Üí Prioritize Feature A
```

#### MoSCoW Method

- **Must Have**: Critical for release (P0)
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical (P1)
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time allows (P2)
- **Won't Have (this time)**: Out of scope for now (P3/Backlog)

#### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort  ‚Üí P0 (Quick Wins - Do First!)
High Value, High Effort ‚Üí P1 (Major Projects - Plan carefully)
Low Value, Low Effort   ‚Üí P2 (Fill-ins - Do if capacity)
Low Value, High Effort  ‚Üí P3 (Time Sinks - Avoid/Backlog)
```

#### Prioritization Matrix Template

| Item | Business Value | Complexity | Dependencies | Urgency | RICE Score | Priority |
|------|---------------|------------|--------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Feature A | High | Low | None | High | 4000 | P0 |
| Feature B | High | High | Feature A | Medium | 3000 | P1 |
| Feature C | Medium | Low | None | Low | 1500 | P2 |
| Bug #123 | High | Medium | None | Critical | - | P0 |

### 3. Sprint Planning

#### Sprint Capacity Calculation

```
Team Capacity = (Team Size √ó Working Days √ó Hours per Day) - (Meetings + Overhead)

Example:
- 3 developers √ó 10 days √ó 6 hours = 180 hours
- Minus meetings (20 hours)
- Minus overhead/slack (15%)
- Available capacity: ~153 hours

Convert to story points or tasks based on team velocity.
```

#### Sprint Goal Definition

A good sprint goal is:
- **Focused**: One clear objective
- **Valuable**: Delivers user/business value
- **Testable**: Can verify if achieved
- **Achievable**: Realistic given capacity

**Example**: "Enable users to receive real-time notifications for mentions"

#### Sprint Backlog Template

```markdown
## Sprint N: [Start Date] - [End Date]

### Sprint Goal
[One-sentence goal]

### Team Capacity
- Available hours: [N] hours
- Velocity (if known): [X] story points

### Committed Items (Must Complete)
1. **Feature A** (P0) - [Story Points/Hours]
   - Assignee: [Name]
   - Dependencies: None
   - Acceptance Criteria: [Key criteria]

2. **Bug #123** (P0) - [Story Points/Hours]
   - Assignee: [Name]
   - Critical: Blocks deployment

### Stretch Goals (If Capacity Allows)
3. **Feature B** (P1) - [Story Points/Hours]
   - Assignee: TBD
   - Only if committed items finish early

### Technical Debt Allocation (20% of capacity)
- Refactor authentication module (4 hours)
- Update dependencies (3 hours)

### Risks
- **Risk**: External API dependency for Feature A
  - Mitigation: Mock API for development, test with real API daily
  - Probability: Medium | Impact: High

- **Risk**: Team member vacation midprint
  - Mitigation: Cross-train on critical path items
  - Probability: High | Impact: Medium
```

### 4. Estimation Techniques

#### Story Points (Fibonacci Scale)

Use relative sizing with Fibonacci numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

- **1 point**: Trivial (< 2 hours)
- **2 points**: Simple (< 1 day)
- **3 points**: Moderate (1-2 days)
- **5 points**: Complex (2-3 days)
- **8 points**: Very complex (1 week)
- **13 points**: Epic (needs breakdown)
- **21+ points**: Too large (must split)

#### T-Shirt Sizing

Quick estimation for early planning:

- **XS**: < 2 hours
- **S**: < 1 day
- **M**: 1-3 days
- **L**: 1 week
- **XL**: 2+ weeks (needs breakdown)

#### Planning Poker

1. Present user story
2. Team discusses
3. Each person privately selects estimate
4. Reveal simultaneously
5. Discuss differences (especially outliers)
6. Re-estimate until consensus

#### Three-Point Estimation

```
Estimate = (Optimistic + (4 √ó Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6

Example:
- Optimistic: 2 days
- Most Likely: 3 days
- Pessimistic: 6 days
- Estimate = (2 + 12 + 6) / 6 = 3.3 days
```

### 5. Capacity Planning

#### Calculate Team Velocity

```
Velocity = Story Points Completed per Sprint (average over 3-5 sprints)

Example:
- Sprint 1: 25 points
- Sprint 2: 30 points
- Sprint 3: 28 points
- Average Velocity: 27.7 points per sprint
```

#### Account for Team Factors

**Reduce capacity for:**
- New team members (50% productivity for first month)
- Vacation/PTO (100% reduction for absent days)
- On-call rotations (20-30% reduction)
- Holidays (100% reduction)
- Training/conferences (100% reduction)

**Example Adjustment**:
```
Base capacity: 180 hours
- Developer A on vacation (2 days): -16 hours
- Developer B on-call: -36 hours (20% of 180)
- Team meeting/ceremonies: -20 hours
Adjusted capacity: 108 hours
```

#### Buffer for Unknowns

Always include buffer:
- **20% buffer** for well-known work
- **30% buffer** for moderate uncertainty
- **50% buffer** for high uncertainty/new technology

**Critical: Avoid These Common Mistakes:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not involving team in estimates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring or hiding risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Over-committing on timelines
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not communicating changes promptly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focusing on process over outcomes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not removing blockers quickly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Micromanaging the team

**Work is Complete When:**

- Project plan established
