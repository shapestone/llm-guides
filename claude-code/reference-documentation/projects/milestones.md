### Tips for Success

- Start with 🔴 Critical and 💰💰💰💰 Critical features first
- Watch for features that are high complexity but low business value - consider cutting them
- Look for quick wins: low complexity + high business/customer value
- Review dependencies regularly to avoid blockers
- Update effort estimates as you learn more during development
- Adjust priorities based on customer feedback and market changes
