## Instructions for Use

### How to Fill Out This Template

1. **Project Overview**: Replace placeholder text with your application name and timeline

2. **Product Versions**: Define all product versions/tiers for your project
    - List each version with its description and target market
    - Examples: Free/Pro/Enterprise, Community/Business/Enterprise, Basic/Standard/Premium
    - These versions will be referenced throughout the roadmap

3. **Releases**: Group milestones into releases (a release is a parent object to milestones)
    - Name each release descriptively (e.g., "Q1 2025 Release", "MVP Launch")
    - Specify which product versions are included in this release
    - Some releases may deploy to all versions, others to a subset
    - A release can contain one or more milestones

4. **Milestones**: Create milestone sections within each release
    - Number milestones by release (e.g., M1.1, M1.2 for Release 1)
    - Name each milestone descriptively (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
    - Set realistic target completion dates

5. **Features**: For each feature, assess and fill in:
    - **Product Versions**: Which product versions receive this feature (use version names or "All")

    - **Priority**: How critical is this feature?
        - 🔴 Critical: Must have for launch
        - 🟠 High: Important for success
        - 🟡 Medium: Nice to have
        - 🟢 Low: Future enhancement

    - **Complexity**: How difficult to implement?
        - ⭐ Simple: Straightforward implementation
        - ⭐⭐ Moderate: Some complexity
        - ⭐⭐⭐ Complex: Significant effort required
        - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Complex: Major undertaking

    - **Business Value**: How much business impact?

        - 👤👤👤 Highly desired: Customers actively request it
        - 👤👤👤👤 Essential: Customers expect and need it

    - **Effort**: Estimate in weeks (or sprint points, days, etc.)

    - **Dependencies**: List features that must be completed first

    - **Notes**: Technical considerations, integration requirements, etc.

6. **Calculate Totals**: Sum up effort estimates for each milestone

7. **Timeline Overviews**: Update both release and milestone timeline tables
    - Release Timeline shows which product versions ship in each release
    - Milestone Timeline shows which milestones belong to which release

8. **Priority Matrix**: Pull critical features from all milestones into this summary view

9. **Resource Allocation**: Describe how you'll distribute team efforts across quarters

### Tips for Success

- **Product Version Strategy**:
    - Consider feature parity vs. differentiation across versions
    - Plan shared features early to avoid duplicate implementation work
    - Document version-specific customizations clearly

- **Release Planning**:
    - Group related milestones into logical releases
    - Some releases may only ship to certain product versions (e.g., Enterprise-only features)
    - Coordinate release timing with product version strategies

- **Feature Prioritization**:
    - Start with 🔴 Critical and 💰💰💰💰 Critical features first
    - Watch for features that are high complexity but low business value - consider cutting them
    - Look for quick wins: low complexity + high business/customer value
    - Consider which product versions need a feature when prioritizing

- **Execution**:
    - Review dependencies regularly to avoid blockers
    - Update effort estimates as you learn more during development
    - Adjust priorities based on customer feedback and market changes
    - Track which product versions have received which features
