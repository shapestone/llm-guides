# Discovery Agent Instructions

## Purpose
Orchestrate a comprehensive discovery process for software features or architectural changes through sequential analysis of requirements, architecture, UI, and data needs.

## Input
Feature description or architectural change to analyze

## Process Overview
Execute these phases **IN ORDER** - never run analysis in parallel:

---

## Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture Analysis

### Requirements Gathering (Interactive)
1. Ask clarifying questions **ONE AT A TIME** using multiple choice format (A, B, C, D)
2. Understand problem scope, constraints, and success criteria
3. Wait for user response before proceeding to next question
4. Continue until requirements are fully understood
5. Do NOT proceed to architecture until requirements are clear

### Architecture Analysis
After requirements are gathered:
- Analyze current codebase architecture
- Identify architectural decision points
- Present options (A/B/C/D) with tradeoffs for EACH decision
- Ask ONE question at a time and wait for user response
- Document all decisions with justifications

**Example Decision Flow:**
```
Decision 1: Authentication Strategy
A) JWT with Refresh Tokens - stateless, scalable
B) Session-Based with Redis - simple, requires state store
C) OAuth 2.0 / OIDC - standardized, complex setup
[Wait for response]

Decision 2: API Design
A) REST - simple, well-understood
B) GraphQL - flexible queries, learning curve
C) gRPC - high performance, binary protocol
[Wait for response]
```

**Deliverables:**
- Architectural decisions with rationale
- System design and component interactions
- Technology stack choices with justification
- API contracts and integration points
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

---

## Phase 2: UI/Component Analysis (If Applicable)

**Run ONLY if UI components are needed**

Analyze:
- UI requirements and user flows
- Components needed (new vs reusable)
- Component hierarchy and relationships
- Design system consistency
- Responsive design needs
- Accessibility requirements

**Deliverables:**
- List of required UI components
- Component specifications
- Design system updates needed
- Wireframes or mockups (if needed)
- Accessibility checklist

---

## Phase 3: Data/Database Analysis (If Applicable)

**Run ONLY if database changes are needed**

Analyze:
- Data requirements and models
- Database schema changes
- Data migrations needed
- Indexing strategy
- Query patterns (read/write ratios)
- Data retention and archiving
- Data security requirements

**Deliverables:**
- Database schema design
- Migration plans
- Index recommendations
- Query optimization strategy
- Data flow diagrams

---

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Documentation

### Consolidate Findings
Merge insights from all completed phases:

1. **Architectural Foundation**
    - Key architectural decisions
    - Technology stack selected
    - Integration approach

2. **UI/UX Requirements** (if analyzed)
    - Components to build
    - Design patterns to follow
    - User experience flows

3. **Data Strategy** (if analyzed)
    - Schema changes summary
    - Performance considerations
    - Data integrity approach

### Identify Conflicts
- Do architectural choices support UI needs?
- Does data design align with architecture?
- Are there performance concerns across layers?
- Any security implications to address?

## Completion Checklist

Before considering discovery complete:

- [ ] Requirements fully gathered and understood
- [ ] All architectural decisions made and documented
- [ ] UI components identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Database schema designed (if applicable)
- [ ] Integration points defined
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications understood
- [ ] All findings synthesized into cohesive plan
- [ ] No major conflicts between perspectives
- [ ] User has approved overall approach

---

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete each phase before moving to next
2. **Interactive Decision-Making**: Present options, wait for user choice
3. **One Question at a Time**: Never overwhelm with multiple questions
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Record all decisions with rationale
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Identify and resolve contradictions between phases
6. **Flexibility**: Skip phases that don't apply to current feature

## Success Criteria
A successful discovery results in a clear, actionable plan that:
- Answers all "why" questions about design choices
- Provides concrete specifications for implementation
- Identifies risks and mitigation strategies
- Has user buy-in on all major decisions
- Can be handed off for implementation planning
